## Introduction

The Force is an innovative project that allows users to control a 3D particle animation through hand gestures. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, this project provides an interactive experience that blends the digital and physical worlds. 

Imagine waving your hands in front of your screen and watching particles dance in response. This project not only showcases the capabilities of modern web technologies but also serves as a practical tutorial for developers interested in augmented reality and gesture recognition.

## Features

- **Real-Time Interaction**: Control animations in real-time with hand gestures.
- **3D Visualization**: Experience stunning 3D particle effects.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on most modern browsers.
- **Easy to Understand**: The code is well-documented and easy to follow.
- **Open Source**: Feel free to modify and improve the code.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library that simplifies the creation of 3D graphics in the browser.
- **WebGL**: A web standard for rendering 3D graphics.
- **MediaPipe**: A framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines, particularly useful for hand tracking.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tinchotinn/the-force.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd the-force
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: If there are any dependencies, install them using npm or yarn. 

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Demo

To run the demo, open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can also use a local server for better performance. If you have Python installed, you can run:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Usage

Once the demo is running, you will see a 3D particle animation on your screen. Follow these steps to interact with it:

1. **Allow Camera Access**: The application requires access to your webcam for hand tracking. Make sure to allow this when prompted.
  
2. **Gesture Recognition**: Move your hands in front of the camera. The system will recognize gestures and control the particle animation accordingly.

3. **Explore Different Gestures**: Experiment with various hand movements to see how they affect the animation.
